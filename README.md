# modemizr

modemizr is a simple Javascript extension that simulates the effect of
reading the page using a modem, typically at low bits-per-second (bps)
rates of 300 to 9600 (you are probably browsing this page on a
connection with **megabit** per second speed).

For samples see `tests/` directory.

## Usage

### Without jQuery

1. Include it on page:

   ```html
   <script src="modemizr.js"></script>
   ```

2. Call `modemizr` with the input and output element and potential
   options:

   ```javascript
   modemizr(document.getElementById("output"),
            document.getElementById("input"),
            { ... options ... });
   ```

   You can also omit the input element in which case the input element
   is used in-place:

   ```javascript
   modemizr(document.getElementById("output"));
   ```

For options see below.

### With jQuery

1. Include it on page:

   ```html
   <script src="modemizr.js"></script>
   ```

2. Call the plugin:

   ```javascript
   $('#output').modemizr();
   ```

## Options

You can pass an options hash for both `modemizr` and to the jQuery
plugin (the values below are the defaults):

    ```javascript
    {
        bps: 300,
        cursor: false,
        blink: false,
        imageSpeedup: 100
    }
    ```

Option | Description
--- | ---
`bps` | Initial BPS value for output
`cursor` | Either `false`, `true` or a string. Adds a cursor `SPAN` element at a place where the cursor is. The element has class of either `"cursor"` or the `cursor` option value if given as a string.
`blink` | Enable blinking cursor by setting `true` or the blink interval in milliseconds
`imageSpeedup` | How much image loading is sped up

If you want your cursor to be visible you will need to add styling:


    ```css
    .cursor:before { content: "."; background: white; color: white; }
    .blink .cursor:before { content: ""; }
    ```

(I'll be happy if someone can tell me how to get rid of the dot so
that it works for both DIV and PRE elements and has a matching width
to the element -- non-breaking space works but results in too wide
cursor.)

## HTML controls

It is possible to change BPS speed and pause by including attributes
in the HTML elements. They have an effect when the element is
encountered, so a `SPAN` with a pause will pause **before** its
contents are processed.

Attribute | Description
--- | ---
`data-pause-chars` | Pause for the equivalent time that would be taken to output this many characters
`data-pause-secs` | Pause for this many seconds (may be a decimal number)
`data-bps` | Change BPS to the value

For example:

    ```html
    <p data-pause-chars="10">10 char pause</p>
    <p data-pause-secs="10">10 second pause</p>
    <p data-bps="19200">Upgrade!!!!</p>
    ```

## Image loading

IMG elements are shown in a way that simulates pixel-by-pixel loading
over a slow link. It assumes that each pixel is one byte (8 bits)
approximating 8-bit indexed color image pixel density and calculates
how many pixels can be shown. (This is not an exact calculation and
neither it is meant to be.)

Then this value is multiplied by `imageSpeedup` parameter which by
default is 100!! This is because image loading at *true speeds* would
be horrendously slow and would move the "slow loading" effect from
curiosity to purely tediously horrendous.

You can change the `imageSpeedup` parameter via options to 1 if you
wish. To. Wait. Forever.
